  This is the product that I always got from Korea and I was so happy to find them from Amazon. And the product is sold by the Aekyung(AK_Beauty) directly so I don't need to worry at all about the originality.  I believe all Korean woman knows this product which was also called ""Í≤¨Î?Î¶??©Ìä∏"" and so popular in Homeshopping channel.  I love this one since it has great coverage and makes my skin tone very smooth. Also, it never dries my skin like other products but makes my skin more radiant and moisturizing. Especially this works so perfectly with dry California weather.I am really happy to find this original product on Amazon!!!

  I have eczema and very dry, very sensitive skin and this product is great. It's very moisturizing but I can still use a little bit of powder and it doesn't cake up. It's also has been pretty long lasting as I work in a boba shop and I'm around steam all day. The only downside to this product is that the shade range is extremely limited.

  I discovered this several years ago when my mom received some as a gift from her sister in Korea.  I used it once in a while because I like my Smashbox liquid foundation... but ever since I gave birth and started WFH due to COVID, I use this every day!  Makes my skin look and feel great (on and off Zoom) and most importantly, is QUICK!  With a few swirls and a pats on my face + a swipe of blush + eyebrow pencil, I'm ready to be on camera.

  This is a really nice cushion! The coverage is truly buildable & long-lasting with a natural, weightless finish. My favorite thing about it is how well it blurs your nose compared to other foundations I've used. My only note is that it won't necessarily cover up redness or dark spots on its own, so you may need some color correction products and/or concealer to do the heavy lifting in trouble areas. But it's really good if you're just looking to give your skin a soft, even finish:) Also, it's super convenient to throw in your bag & apply on the go!

  Great texture and so moisturizing. If you have dry skin, this would be the perfect one to go and even if you have normal skin type like me, this is great. It is also good for covering dark spots and making your skin look flawless.This is my second time using makeup pact product from this company and I loved the first one as well. I strongly recommend this.

  I was able to use this without a cc underneath! I would advise not using the pad it comes with until you are comfortable.  I used a brush and started very gently.  It?ôs definitely buildable as well.  It does not go on cakes, but if you touch your face it feels sticky, just as a setting powder (I?ôm 50, so I try not to to) or finish spray.  For the price you are getting 2 and it did nit take much.  I would highly recommend.  I am very fair, but decided to try the light beige due to the redness on my face and it turned our great, so it is for fair skin types.  How this helps!

  I have a combination skin type which makes me really hard to choose a foundation compact. It works great on my face that fully covers pores, blemish and redness. It does improve my skin tone better. And also it covers blemish on my face as well. It looks very natural and doesn't even look cakey at all.

  I love this foundation!! I used Age20's pink cover foundation and decided to try this black cover one this time. It didn't disappoint me either. What I really like about this product is that it moisturizes my face on top of covering any blemishes. So when I apply it, my face doesn't look dry like other foundations or powders. It's also very natural instead of looking like you are wearing an extra layer of powder cake on your face.I don't do a lot of make up, so applying this is just perfect because it still makes my face natural looking. I strongly recommend this to anyone. You have to try it.For the pink one, I had two refills and used it for 3 years, so I am expecting that the extra refill from this product will be years-worth of spend.

  I really like this! I?ôm a 23 year old female with sensitive, dry skin (but oily nose from time to time). Other bb cushions seemed fine for the first hour but resulted to dryness after a couple hours or so. This product was different. After application, it gives me the just amount of dewyness and glow for the day! It also has buildable coverage. This product also claims that it makes your skin better while you?ôre using it. I don?ôt know if that?ôs true, but my skin has NOT gotten worse ever since I started using this product and no breaks outs whatsoever. I will definitely be purchasing this product again!

  I?ôve been using Age 20?ôs pact for a few years now and absolutely love it. I have an extremely dry and sensitive/eczema prone skin and this moisturizing pact works wonders! Note that this does NOT provide lots of coverage and is meant to give watery/glowy look. This is my go to pact during winter and I rotate it it with Hera cushion during summer because it can be a little sticky during humid summers. For this specific series, you may want to go one tone higher (I normally use 23 beige but got 21 based on the reviews and fits my skin perfectly).

  A lovely product, cram like in consistency and not a cushion. Excellent coverage and the final tone is perfect for my hard to match, pale beige base skin with out being overly yellow or pink. Delivered promptly And now a regular component of myMakeup for work days. I had been expecting a cushion and was very pleasantly surprised

  ¬†The product works beautifully. However, I had to give only 3 stars because the case broke only after 3 months. The latch to close it shut doesn?ôt work anymore. I can?ôt take it anywhere! What a shame and disappointment.

  I was a little worried about buying foundation online, but I'm so glad I did. It matched my skin tone perfectly! It has a very light, breathable feel and makes your skin glow. I have dry skin and it really added a lot of moisture. A added bonus is it smells very nice. I would definitely recommend buying.

  In love with everything I?ôve tried for Age 20s. It?ôs moisturizing without being greasy or sticky. The skin drinks in the foundation like a high end skin treatment.  It?ôs buildable so you can go sheer but it will also cover your flaws. Natural flawless beauty.  I always get compliments on not only my skin but with how young I look.  All of my friends, family and clients that I?ôve recommended this to have also loved it and have been repeat customers like me.I even keep one at home and a separate one in my purse just in case... so I always have one on me at all times.I have always appreciated that they are thoughtful even to give you a new poof with each refill. Brava! This is as it should be and yet so many other brands don?ôt provide that extra courtesy to their customers showing that they actually care for you and your skin.I?ôm a ?úfairly light??in Bare Minerals powder of that helps and this color is perfect for me.  They have one other color that is too light and the other too dark.... so my color is the middle one but I can never remember the number ?òÇ.As a girl with a short attention span and little patience for disappointing foundations I think that the fact that I?ôve bought this at least 7 times now in the last couple years since discovering it and will always make sure I have one in the vicinity is a sign that you won?ôt regret trying this too. ?òä?íÉ?èªIf you have oily skin, check the other Age 20s cushions - they have many and I would say this one is more for normal, combination, dry or sensitive skin.

  Very impressed. I normally use Missha 13 BB and this is a great color match. I normally dislike CC cushions as they are not very long lasting and tend to oxidize. This one is great (maybe because the formula is different from a regular cushion). The texture is fantastic and the coverage is buildable. Shade 13 was somewhat translucent and neutral toned.

  Tried it once more.  I think there is a learning curve. I have dry skin, so had to adapt. It is still drying for my skin type, but I can adjust for that.  Sorry for the negative review.
