  This feels kind of thick but it absorbs so fast into the skin. I can?™t even feel it but it is so moisturizing.

  This cream is very moisturizing and absorbs quickly. I liked it as it does not leave a sticky residue after use. Best of all its fragrance free. Also just wanted to mention this brand is South Korean and is known to not have any harsh chemicals.

  Thick, but works. For me I prefer the mild fragrance free lotion since it's thinner and comes in a pump bottle.

  It has a silky texture that I love

  This is a thick body cream that's very moisturizing and great for winter. It doesn't feel sticky or uncomfortable on the skin. I also like that it's fragrance free. Derma B is a very good Korean skincare brand. Of course their packaging will not have English on it, if you want to know the ingredients check the description or look it up. This was a weird complaint on some of their product reviews... They are trustworthy and use very safe ingredients!

  It's probably my favorite body lotion. It's very moisturizing but not sticky. The price is reasonable. It?™s on the thick side for a lotion, which I love because I have extremely dry skin especially on my legs. I?™m glad I discovered this product. So far, it has been very moisturizing and provides instant dry relief. I have dry skin and end up buying creams or body butters. They end up being quite sticky and inconvenient to apply during the day. However, this lotion absorbs quickly and leaves the skin feeling soft. It smell a bit like baby powder but that goes away once the lotion sinks into the skin. My skin is soft and smooth and there is no cracking or bleeding around the elbow and ankle areas. Plus it has no nasty ingredients so definitely will repurchase.

  This thick lotion feels very good to my 62 year old dry skin.  It moisturizes very well and has literally no scent whatsoever.  It goes on easily and seems to soften my skin immediately, even making it look smoother and more youthful.  But, I'm deducting one star because there is no way to know what the ingredients are unless you can read Korean.  I feel that if a product is sold in the United States then the ingredients and other pertinent information should be printed somewhere in English.

  This is a fairly thick cream, and certainly thicker than a lotion, great for night time use. Yet the way it's fragrance-free, one can use it anytime, anywhere. My wife loves it and uses it the most, and she has dry skin.It spreads easily and absorbs quickly. It has what some call 'essential hydrators'. These are the main ingredients that add and lock in moisture.

  The cream inside of this jar is thick and fragrance-free.  That is all I can write about this product because the ingredient list and the label in in Chinese.  Chinese products are known to contain bleach because white, clear skin is ""ideal"".If the ingredient list on the Amazon website is to be believed, there is still Sodium Hyaluronate listed, which is a product used to treat knee pain and other joint pain. Why that ingredient is in a lotion is questionable and makes one wonder what other unnecessary ingredients this lotion contains.I also question the legality of selling a product that isn't labeled in English to the US market.
